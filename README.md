## Why?
We thought it would be fun for folks who contribute to our open source projects to get some recognition on their GitHub profile page for their contributions. It's not everyday people like you spend their time helping to make our projects better. You'll potentially have code runnning on millions of devices, but that's not all, now you're have a badge on your GitHub profile. Seriously though, we're super grateful for your support. Thank you! 

## Joining
Anybody who has made contributions to our public codebases can become a member! How do you become a member? Open an issue on this repo and point to your contribution. 

That's it!

It does take us humans a moment to do this, but maybe we'll automate that in the future... or you can, as your first contribution? ðŸ˜º
